## Introduction to Packet Tracer

**Cisco Packet Tracer** is a network simulation tool that allows users to create network topologies, configure devices, and troubleshoot networks virtually. It is primarily used for educational purposes and helps in understanding how real networks function.

### Features:
- **Simulate network devices:** Routers, switches, PCs, and wireless devices.
- **Configure networks:** IP addressing, routing protocols, and security.
- **Test and troubleshoot:** Use built-in tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and protocol inspectors to analyze traffic.

## Peer-to-Peer Communication

### What is Peer-to-Peer Communication?

Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication refers to the direct connection between two network devices (such as PCs) without the need for an intermediary device like a router or switch. This is often used in small networks for sharing files, printers, or other resources.

### Setting Up Peer-to-Peer in Packet Tracer

1. **Add two PCs** to the workspace from the device list.
2. **Connect the PCs** using a **crossover cable**:
    - Select a **copper crossover cable** from the cable options.
    - Connect it to the **Ethernet ports** of both PCs.
3. **Assign IP addresses**:
    - Click on each PC, go to the **Desktop tab**, and select **IP Configuration**.
    - Assign IP addresses to both PCs in the same subnet. Example:
      - PC 1: `192.168.1.1 / 255.255.255.0`
      - PC 2: `192.168.1.2 / 255.255.255.0`
4. **Test the connection**:
    - Use the `ping` command from one PC to the other to ensure connectivity:
    ```bash
    ping 192.168.1.2
    ```

## Study of Cables and Color Codes

### Types of Network Cables

1. **Straight-Through Cable**: Used to connect different types of devices (e.g., a PC to a switch or a router to a switch).
2. **Crossover Cable**: Used to connect similar devices (e.g., a PC to another PC or a switch to another switch).
3. **Fiber Optic Cable**: Used for long-distance, high-speed connections. It uses light
